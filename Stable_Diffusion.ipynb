        "\n",
        "Stable Diffusion is a powerful text-to-image generative model developed by [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/). It uses a type of deep learning called diffusion models to generate highly realistic images from textual descriptions (called prompts). Unlike earlier models that were often slow or required massive hardware, Stable Diffusion is designed to be efficient and open-source, allowing individuals to run it on consumer-grade GPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key features include:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🔤 **Text-to-Image Generation:** You input a sentence like “a cyberpunk city at night,” and it generates a unique image based on that.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🧠 **Latent Diffusion:** Instead of working directly in pixel space, it operates in a compressed “latent” space, which makes it faster and more memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🛠️ **Customizability:** Users can fine-tune it or use tools like ControlNet, LoRA, and DreamBooth to guide image generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🌍 **Open Source:** Anyone can download and run it, sparking a large community of artists, developers, and hobbyists.\n",
